# Customer Churn Prediction ML Project

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will churn (leave a service) using machine learning. It uses the *Telco Customer Churn dataset* and implements a *Random Forest Classifier* to identify customers most likely to churn. The project is designed to be *industry-level*, clean, and ready for professional presentation.
